Project Documentation This repository contains project documentation organized into five major phases of development. Each phase includes relevant files that explain the project's progress from idea generation to performance testing. 🧠 Ideation Phase This phase focuses on idea creation and understanding the problem deeply. Brainstorm – Idea Generation & Prioritization Contains various ideas collected during brainstorming sessions and explains how the final idea was selected. Define Problem Statement Clearly defines the problem that the project aims to solve. Empathy Map Canvas Helps understand the user's feelings, needs, challenges, and expectations to build a user-centered solution. 📊 Requirement Analysis This phase explains what the system should do and the essential needs to build the solution. Data Flow Diagrams and User Stories Shows how data flows in the system and explains user interactions with the application. Solution Requirements Contains functional and non-functional requirements of the project. Technology Stack Lists the technologies, tools, programming languages, frameworks, and platforms used to develop the project. 🛠 Project Design Phase In this phase, the solution structure and the system blueprint are designed. Problem-Solution Fit Explains how the proposed solution properly addresses the problem. Proposed Solutions Includes different possible solutions and why the selected one is the best. Solution Architecture Provides the high-level design of the system, including modules, system interactions, and architecture diagrams. 📅 Project Planning Phase This phase deals with planning how the project will be executed. Project Planning Includes project timeline, milestones, resource allocation, roles and responsibilities, and risk management strategies. ⚙️ Performance Testing This phase evaluates the efficiency and performance of the system. Performance Testing Includes test results, system response time, load/stress testing, and suggestions for performance improvement. ✅ Purpose ✔ To provide a structured and organized documentation of the entire project ✔ To help in academic submissions, presentations, and future reference ✔ To track the project development lifecycle from idea to testing DEMO VEDIO LINK :https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VVUlOXrkNUtpTbUhSm1VDovP8Hb_djMW/view?usp=drivesdk
